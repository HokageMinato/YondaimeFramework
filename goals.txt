Yondaime Framework.

Anatomy:
 
 RootLibrary -> Central to Game.
 SystemLibrary	-> Central to Scene.
 BehavioursLibrary -> Central To System Aspect.

Improvements:
 > [DONE] Rename SystemLibrary to SceneLibrary. 

 > [DONE]RootLibrary resides in DontDestoryOnLoad and is updated sceneLibrary upon
	loading and unloading of scene.
	
 > [DONE] Add FindBehaviour-s<T>() to CustomBehaviour which scans from RootLibrary and finds 
	everthing related from its system libraries.
	
 > [DONE]GetComponentByID in sceneLibrary and a dictionary which maintains stuff mapped to ID
 
 
 > Scriptable Objects layers named custom scriptable, with property drawer list to filled with types to filter.
   Each filter removes items not preset in drawer list. drawer items would be types.
   
 > Ids from several instances of containers combined, showing all of them together in drawer.

 > None option for ID [DONE]
 
 > Horizontal layout display for editor buttons [DONE]
 
 > Optimized GetComponentFromGameObject by assigning indexes to objects. //Near Performance to GetComponentAchieved, Still needs work
 
 > GetComponentByID, using string ids with type and concating takes too much load, Find a better way
 
 > Add proper Exceptions for [Library not assigned] [Library not initialized] [Nulls Present in Library, require refresh]

 > locking of resource when queried during hierarchy change, or hierarchy change during query.
 
 
 > ComponentId Seperate drawer which takes all	of id sources and displayes for parameter;
	byte packed with str id, stored in component, hidden, used only when queried;
