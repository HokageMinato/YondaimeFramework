Yondaime Framework.

Anatomy:
 
 RootLibrary -> Central to Game.
 SystemLibrary	-> Central to Scene.
 BehavioursLibrary -> Central To System Aspect.

Improvements:
 > Rename SystemLibrary to SceneLibrary.

 > RootLibrary resides in DontDestoryOnLoad and is updated sceneLibrary upon
	loading and unloading of scene.
	
 > Add FindBehaviour-s<T>() to CustomBehaviour which scans from RootLibrary and finds 
	everthing related from its system libraries.
