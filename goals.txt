Goals:
 Yondaime namespace framework
 RootLibrary -> Central to Scene
 SystemLibrary	-> Central to respective System
 BehavioursLibrary -> Central aspect of System
 
Method extensions required
 GetSystemLibrary(System Id)
 GetRootLibrary()


 -> Scan only the lib parent to it and not other.
 -> Seperate library initialization/lookup generation and runtime library refresh
 -> Central initialization for all libraries
 -> System init called post library initialization ends.
 
 
 SystemBehaviourLibrary shouldhave capacity to traverse recursivly in child libs
 RootBehaviourLibrary should be able to return all SystemBehaviourLibraries
 Root should inherit system
 Root should have a master refresh which updates upon hierarchy change
 System libs should be manually updated ?...
